# Before you start

Make sure you have Docker installed.

# Start SimpleIdServer

Download the [docker-compose.yml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simpleidserver/SimpleIdServer/release/2.0.0/conf/docker/2.0.0/docker-compose.yml) file and execute the command line `docker-compose up`. 

This will start [SimpleIdServer](http://localhost:4200) exposed on the port 4200. It will also create an initial admin user with username `administrator` and password `password`.
